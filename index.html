                <p>
                    As a daily commuter, and many others, people lack the time to make decisions. This may include the food they want to eat, the attire they want to don, what they want to do that evening, and so on. Our goal is that by designing an app to address these daily challenges, we are able to effectively accommodate people who lack decision making skills, busy people with no time on their hands to ponder small decisions, and people who simply want to spice up their life a little.
